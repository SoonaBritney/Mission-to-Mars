# 1. Objectives

(1). Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
In this chellenge, using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, I scraped full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

(2). Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using the Python and HTML skills, I added the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

(3). Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
For this part of the Challenge, I updated the web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.

We added the bootstrap Bootstrap grid examples to be responsive for mobile ipad display.

# 3.Conclusion
Web scraping is very powerful method to scrap the content and recreate a web site & pages dynamically. BeautifulSoup and Splinter are very helpful tool  as well as Chrome dev tool. To do this, we use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
